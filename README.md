# ADC-Project

In this project I demonstrated how I configured the ADC module 0 to sample the potentiomenter and the analog light sensor on the EduBase board. The primary goal was to introduce the principles of ADC operations and demonstrate how to process analog signals. I then learned to sample different voltage levels and convert the values into digital form and interpret the data. The potentiometer allowed me to experiment with input levels manually and the light sensor showed me the concept of environmental sensing.

Here I covered the sensor with my hand and the light sensor level was low because there was no light on the sensor.

Here I did not cover the sensor and the light level increased drastically.
